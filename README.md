# Tempo Converter

This is an app for converting BPM values to MS values built in react native

## The problem

I'm a semi-pro audio engineer and enjoy running live sound.  The M32/X32 are great budget consoles used in countless venues.  Being a budget console, it doesn't have a global BPM like other consoles have.  So inorder to keep your delays and other time based effects in time with the song, you need to know the MS value of the quarter note for each song.

## The solution

This app provides a tap tempo functionality, for finding the tempo of a song, then it allows you to convert that BPM value to a subset of user-defined subdivisions giving you the MS value at each of those subdivisions that you can use for your  time based effects on consoles without that functionality built in.
